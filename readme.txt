docker-compose up --build -d

When to Use --build:

    Changes to Dockerfiles: If you have made changes to your Dockerfiles and need those changes to be reflected in your running containers, you should use --build.

    Changes to Dependencies: If there have been changes to dependencies or configurations that affect how the Docker image is built, you should rebuild the images.

    Initial Setup: If it's the first time you are setting up the project and you need to ensure that all images are built from scratch.

When Not to Use --build:

    No Changes to Images: If there have been no changes to the Dockerfiles or the files used in the build process, you don't need to rebuild the images. Docker Compose will use the existing images.

    Speed: Rebuilding images can be time-consuming. If you don't need to rebuild, omitting --build will save time.

    Using Pre-built Images: If you are using pre-built images from a registry and haven't made any changes that require rebuilding, you can skip the --build option.
